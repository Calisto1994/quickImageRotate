### quickImageRotate TODO

## File formats
Add `createimagefromAny ($filename)` function to support directly the inclusion of PNG, BMP and WebP files

## Output formats
Add a setting to allow the user to create not only JPEG files but also PGN, BMP or WebP files

## But what about the `Final Relase` commit ??
Forget about it. I wanted to be lazy and finish this but I've just got too many ideas about how to improve this thing... so I'll continue
until I might one day run out of new ideas. But I don't now when this might be.
